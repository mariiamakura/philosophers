## creating threads 

```
#include <pthread.h>

int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr, void *(*fun)(void *), void *arg);

```
The pthread_create() function is used to create a new thread, with attributes specified by attr, within a process.  If attr is NULL, the default attributes are used.  If the attributes specified by attr are modified later, the thread's attributes are not affected.  Upon successful completion pthread_create() will store the ID of the created thread in the location specified by thread.

RETURN VALUES
If successful, the pthread_create() function will return zero.  Otherwise an error number will be returned to indicate the error.
```
void *test(void *data)
{
  printf("Hello");
  return(0);
}

int main()
{
  pthread_t id;
  pthread_create(&id, NULL, test, NULL); //the 4th param is an argument to the fun(3rd param)
  //join or detach
  return(0);
}
```

**remember that main() is a thread itself that can finish before your second thread is executed (in case of the code above). To make thread wait until the specific one is finished, use following ->

## thread_join / thread_detach

```
int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **retval);
```
The pthread_join() function waits for the thread specified by thread to terminate.  If that thread has already terminated, then  pthread_join() returns immediately.  The thread specified by thread must be joinable. If  retval  is  not NULL, then pthread_join() copies the exit status of the target thread (i.e., the value that the target thread  supplied  to pthread_exit(3)) into the location pointed to by retval. 
If  multiple  threads  simultaneously try to join with the same thread, the results are undefined.  If the  thread  calling  pthread_join()  is canceled,  then  the  target thread will remain joinable (i.e., it will not be detached).

RETURN VALUE
On success, pthread_join() returns 0; on error,  it  returns  an  error number.

```
void *test(void *data)
{
  printf("Hello");
  return(0);
}

int main()
{
  pthread_t id;
  pthread_create(&id, NULL, test, NULL); //the 4th param is an argument to the fun(3rd param)
  pthread_join(&id)
  return(0);
}
```

```
int pthread_detach(pthread_t thread);
```
The  pthread_detach() function marks the thread identified by thread as detached.  When a detached thread terminates, its resources  are  auto‚Äêmatically  released  back  to  the  system without the need for another thread to join with the terminated thread.


RETURN VALUE
On  success,  pthread_detach() returns 0; on error, it returns an error number.

!! pthread_join() blocks the calling thread until the specified thread completes and allows retrieving the exit status of the joined thread.
!! pthread_detach() marks a thread as detached, allowing it to clean up its resources independently upon completion, without the need for another thread to join it.

## data racing or how to prevent the thread from using data while the other one is not finished

it's a good practice to protect your variable with the mutex if one or more threads can change it. If threads only read data, protection is not mandatory.

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <pthread.h>

//mutex is sort of the lock

int mails = 0;
pthread_mutex_t mutex;

void* routine() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
        mails++;
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
    }
    return (NULL);
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    pthread_t p1, p2, p3, p4;
    pthread_mutex_init(&mutex, NULL); //the lock

    //threads can be executed before one is fully finished
    if (pthread_create(&p1, NULL, &routine, NULL) != 0) {
        return 1;
    }
    if (pthread_create(&p2, NULL, &routine, NULL) != 0) {
        return 2;
    }
    if (pthread_join(p1, NULL) != 0) {
        return 3;
    }
    if (pthread_join(p2, NULL) != 0) {
        return 4;
    }
    pthread_mutex_destroy(&mutex);
    printf("Number of mails: %d\n", mails);
    return 0;
}

```

too use mutex:
```
pthread_mutex_t mutex;
pthread_mutex_init(&mutex, NULL); - initialize it
pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex); //lock and unlock
pthread_mutex_destroy(&mutex); //destroy

```

## creating thread in a loop

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <pthread.h>

//mutex is sort of the lock
//mutex = 1 - i'm busy with something
//mutex = 0 - i'm free

int mails = 0;
pthread_mutex_t mutex;

void* routine() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
        mails++;
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
    }
    return (NULL);
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    int i;

    pthread_t th[4];
    pthread_mutex_init(&mutex, NULL); //the lock
    for (i = 0; i < 4; i++){
        if (pthread_create(&th[i], NULL, &routine, NULL) != 0)
            return 1;
        printf("Thread %i started\n", i);
    }
    for (i = 0; i < 4; i++){
        if (pthread_join(th[i], NULL) != 0)
            return (2);
        printf("Thread %i ended\n", i);
    }
    pthread_mutex_destroy(&mutex);
    printf("mails: %i\n", mails);
    return 0;
}
```

## project architecture 

Since global variables are not allowed in this project, a good idea for storing data and mutex would be struct
```
typedef struct s_data{
pthread_mutex_t *mutex;
int *data;
} t_data;
```
